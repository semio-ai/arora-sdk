## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- `NaoqiHal`: NAO and Pepper robots as Arora devices over their NAOqi middleware,
  through `libqi-vibe` (the `qi` framework in pure Rust, no C++ SDK).
- `standard`: the Arora robot standard the HAL maps NAOqi onto, as data
  (`standard/arora-robot.json`, Vizij's profile shape): every key with its kind, type,
  unit and range. Local to this HAL until Arora has a standard.
- Sensed keys: `<joint>.position|velocity|stiffness|temperature|current`,
  `battery.charge|current|charging`, `imu.angle.{x,y}`, `imu.gyroscope.{x,y,z}`,
  `imu.accelerometer.{x,y,z}`, `sonar.{left,right}.distance`, `touch.head.*`,
  `touch.hand.*`, `bumper.*`, `chest_button`.
- Commanded keys: `<joint>.target_position`, `<joint>.target_stiffness`,
  `led.<group>.color`, `led.<group>.intensity`, `velocity.{x,y}`, `rotation.z`.
- Autonomous Life is turned off when the HAL connects (`ALAutonomousLife.setState`), so
  that the robot's own life does not move the joints the device drives;
  `disable_autonomous_life: false` in the configuration keeps it on.
- Behavior leaves as host modules: `say` (the trees' speech contract, in the robot's
  voice through `ALTextToSpeech`; `NaoqiHal::voice` and `say::install`) and
  `gestures::hands_ready`.
- `arora-naoqi` runner binary (feature `runner`): the HAL, the leaves, and a default
  behavior tree (`trees/ready.groot.xml`: "Arora is ready" with a hand gesture), replayed
  by the terminal UI's `r` key or by writing `command.behavior`; `--tree` and `--no-tree`
  choose another tree or none. Cross-compiles for the NAO (`i686-unknown-linux-musl`).
